## Set up dependancies for your dev environ

1. git installed (git-scm.com/download)
1. npm / nodejs installed
1. Sublime Text (v3) installed
1. Set up http://packagecontrol.io in sublime (for autocompletion)
1. Install Typescript package in Sublime: (CTRL+SHIFT+P) -> "Package: Install" -> Typescript
1. Pull down the repo

### Some suggested tips, hints

I have a few git aliases set up for my git environment. This is my favorite.

  `git config --global alias.lsd "log --oneline --graph --decorate"`

  Now type `git lsd` to get a short-line history with graphing and tags.


## Getting started with NPM

Global set up
1. `npm install -g angular-cli`
1. `npm install -g typescript typings`


Project Set up / Start
1. `cd quickstart`	Get into project folder
1. `npm install`   Install dependencies
1. `npm start`   Start the local server environ!

See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/ for details

## Working

To start, I've created a new actual project called `badges-app`, 
and to learn I've also pulled down the `quickstart` from github.com/angular/quickstart.  Each has its own subfolder.
