# badges-for-me

## Set up dependancies for your dev environ

1. git installed (git-scm.com/download)
1. npm / nodejs installed
1. Sublime Text (v3) installed
1. Set up http://packagecontrol.io in sublime (for autocompletion)
1. Install Typescript package: (CTRL+SHIFT+P) -> "Package: Install" -> Typescript
1. Pull down the repo

### Some suggested tips, hints

I have a few git aliases set up for my git environment. This is my favorite.

  `git config --global alias.lsd "log --oneline --graph --decorate"`


## Getting started with NPM

1. `npm install -g angular-cli`
2. `npm install -g typescript typings`

## Working

To start, I've created a new actual project called `badges-app`, 
and to learn I've also pulled down the quickstart from github.com/angular/quickstart.  Each has its own subfolder.
